# Scanline

*never miss the signal*

Full-screen calendar overlays for macOS. CRT-style notifications that cut through deep focus when it matters.

## Install

```
make build
make run
```

Requires macOS 14.0+. No dependencies.

## How it works

Scanline lives in your menu bar, monitors your calendars, and throws a full-screen CRT-style overlay when an event is about to start. Dismiss or snooze — then dive back in.
